bool():-
	this return true if it' an non empty one and this is not an type conversation like int()
lower() and lower difference:-
	lower() is a like a inbuilt call function to make the string lowercase , even though lower doesn't give a error as it is an refrence but
it doesnt call the function , so the string wont change to lowercase 
strip():-
	used to remove all types of spaces like newline

1)Python has else statement not just for "if condition" but also for "while loop",the "else condition" when
used with "while loop" runs only when the "while loop" completes without any break or exit
2)Always leave two lines after creation of function or class for PEP 8
3)Class shouldnt empty so add the key 'pass'
4)__init__.py is considered as an Package
5)In random.randint (1,5) the values are 1,2..5 (including 5 but this is not case for range)
6) when returning "x,y" or "(x,y)" are same because both are tuples
